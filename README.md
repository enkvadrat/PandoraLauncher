# Pandora Launcher

## Comparison between Pandora and other launchers

In addition to the features below, each launcher also has different performance and design characteristics. For example, Prism takes 4 clicks to create a Fabric instance (New Instance > Edit Instance > Install Fabric > Confirm), whereas Pandora and Modrinth allow you to install Fabric directly on the create instance page. These design characteristics are subjective and you should form your own opinion on what design works best for you. Performance is similarly complex, and you should experiment with different launchers if performance is a priority for you.
